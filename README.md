### Spotlight: **Arthur and the Invisibles**  
This film focuses on the stories told by the main character's grandfather. These stories always seemed fascinating, but the main character never imagined that one day he would be a part of that magical world.

### Most Recent Favorite: **The Orville**  
This series is like **Star Trek**, but I found it even more fascinating! Each episodeâ€™s events, the intriguing characters, and the overall magical vibe make it truly unique. Being a huge fan of space and sci-fi, I highly recommend this series to any sci-fi enthusiasts.
